## CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED DURING TESTING

### 1. React Hooks Server-Side Import Issue üîß FIXED
- **Problem:** React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`) were being imported in server-side API routes
- **Impact:** Caused 500 errors on all API endpoints
- **Solution:** Separated client-side hooks into `/hooks/useErrorStream.ts` with `'use client'` directive
- **Result:** All API endpoints now return proper 403 authentication errors instead of 500 server errors

### 2. Client-Server Code Separation üîß FIXED
- **Problem:** Mixed client and server code in realtime streaming module
- **Solution:** Created separate client-side hooks file while maintaining server-side functionality
- **Result:** Improved system stability and proper Next.js App Router compliance
