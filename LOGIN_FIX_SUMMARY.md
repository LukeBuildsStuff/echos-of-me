# Login Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved: User Account Did Not Exist

The login wasn't working because the user account `lukemoeller@yahoo.com` didn't exist in the database.

## Solution Applied

1. **Created User Account**
   - Email: `lukemoeller@yahoo.com`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Name: Luke Moeller
   - Role: admin

2. **User Details**
   - User ID: 2
   - Admin access: Granted
   - Account status: Active

## How to Login Now

1. Go to: http://localhost:3001/auth/signin
2. Enter credentials:
   - Email: `lukemoeller@yahoo.com`
   - Password: `password123`
3. Click "Sign In"

## What Was The Problem?

- The authentication system was working correctly
- NextAuth was properly configured
- The database was connected
- **The only issue was that no user account existed for your email**

## Additional Notes

- The test user `test@example.com` also exists with password `testpassword123`
- Both users have admin access
- The authentication logs show the system was trying to authenticate but couldn't find the user
- Now that the user exists, login should work immediately

## If Login Still Doesn't Work

Try these steps:
1. Clear your browser cookies/cache
2. Open an incognito/private window
3. Make sure you're using the exact credentials above
4. Check Docker logs: `docker logs echosofme_app --tail 50`
