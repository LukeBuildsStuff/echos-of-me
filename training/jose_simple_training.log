2025-08-05 08:48:01,130 - INFO - We will use 90% of the memory on device 0 for storing the model, and 10% for the buffer to avoid OOM. You can set `max_memory` in to a higher value to use more memory (at your own risk).
2025-08-05 08:48:02,944 - ERROR - ❌ Jose training failed: CUDA error: no kernel image is available for execution on the device
CUDA kernel errors might be asynchronously reported at some other API call, so the stacktrace below might be incorrect.
For debugging consider passing CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1
Compile with `TORCH_USE_CUDA_DSA` to enable device-side assertions.
