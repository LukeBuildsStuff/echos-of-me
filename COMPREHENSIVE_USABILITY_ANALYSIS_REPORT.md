## üî¥ Critical Issues (Immediate Attention Required)

### 1. JavaScript Client-Side Error on Sign-In Page
**Severity:** Critical  
**Location:** `/auth/signin`  
**Issue:** React hydration error with event handlers
```
Error: Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props.
<button className=... onClick={function onClick} children=...>
```
**Impact:** May prevent form submission and authentication
**Recommendation:** Convert the sign-in form to a Client Component or fix server-side rendering issues

### 2. Missing Favicon
**Severity:** Warning  
**Location:** `/favicon.ico` (404 Not Found)  
**Impact:** Unprofessional appearance in browser tabs
**Recommendation:** Add a proper favicon.ico file to the public directory

### 3. Admin Access Control
**Severity:** Critical (Security)  
**Location:** `/api/admin/users` (403 Forbidden)  
**Issue:** While security is working, error handling may be unclear to users
**Recommendation:** Ensure admin pages provide clear feedback about access requirements

---

## üü° Usability Issues (Should Fix)

### 1. Navigation Clarity
**Issue:** Limited navigation on authentication pages
**Impact:** Users may feel lost or unable to return to home
**Recommendation:** Add consistent header navigation across all pages

### 2. Loading States
**Issue:** No visible loading indicators for async operations
**Impact:** Users unsure if actions are processing
**Recommendation:** Implement loading spinners and progress indicators

### 3. Error Messaging
**Issue:** Generic error handling without user-friendly messages
**Impact:** Poor user experience when things go wrong
**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive error boundary with helpful messages

### 4. Form Validation Feedback
**Issue:** Limited real-time validation feedback
**Impact:** Users may submit invalid forms multiple times
**Recommendation:** Add inline validation with clear error messages
