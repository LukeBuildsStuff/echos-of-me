## Phase 2: RTX 5090 CUDA Compatibility Resolution

### Initial Challenge
RTX 5090 uses sm_120 architecture (CUDA compute capability 12.0), which wasn't supported by standard PyTorch versions, causing:
```
CUDA error: no kernel image is available for execution on the device
```

### Solution Implementation
**Agent Used**: rtx-5090-cuda-specialist

**Docker Container Solution**:
```bash
# Used NVIDIA's cutting-edge PyTorch container
docker run --gpus all -it --rm \
  -v /home/luke/personal-ai-clone/web:/workspace \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:25.04-py3 bash
```

**PyTorch Version**: 2.7.0a0+ce9e7ef (with sm_120 support)
**CUDA Version**: 12.7
**Container**: nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:25.04-py3

### Verification
```bash
python3 -c "
import torch
print(f'PyTorch: {torch.__version__}')
print(f'CUDA Available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')
print(f'Device: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}')
print(f'CUDA Capability: {torch.cuda.get_device_capability(0)}')
"
```

**Output Confirmed**:
- PyTorch: 2.7.0a0+ce9e7ef

knowin' their old man works his ass off to put food on the table and 
keep a roof over their heads. Twenty years bustin' my back in construction, 
and every day I come home exhausted, but seein' them smile? That's what 
it's all about, buddy."
