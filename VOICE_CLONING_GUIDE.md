- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (5 stars): Complete voice profile

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "Voice profile not found"
- **Solution**: Record new voice passages
- **Action**: Go to Dashboard ‚Üí Voice Clone tab

#### "Voice is warming up"
- **Cause**: First-time model loading
- **Solution**: Wait 30 seconds, retry
- **Normal**: Only happens on first use

#### "Voice authentication needed"
- **Cause**: Session expired
- **Solution**: Refresh page and re-login
- **Prevention**: Keep browser tab active

#### Poor voice quality
- **Cause**: Short or unclear recordings
- **Solution**: Re-record with better audio
- **Tips**: 45+ second passages, clear speech
