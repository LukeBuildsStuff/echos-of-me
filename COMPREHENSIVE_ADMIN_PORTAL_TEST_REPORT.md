## API Security Analysis

### Authentication Flow:
```typescript
// Admin authentication with role-based permissions
export async function verifyAdminPermission(email: string, permission: AdminPermission) {
  const result = await query(`

    FROM users u
    LEFT JOIN admin_roles ar ON u.admin_role_id = ar.id
    WHERE u.email = $1 AND u.is_admin = true AND u.is_active = true
  `)
